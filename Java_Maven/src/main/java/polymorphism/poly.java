	 * Types
	 * 
	 * 1- Compile time /early binding / static binding / overloading 
	 * 2- Runtime / late binding / dynamic binding / overriding
	 * 
	 * - early binding
	 * 
	 * Overloading -- Same method name and different method signatures
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Q - Can we achieve Overloading by keeping the method signature same and
	 * changing its return type ?
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Compile time -- things are decided at compile time compile time itself we can
	 * see all the overloaded methods
	 * 
	 * early biding -it is binded before we run method
	 * 
	 * static biding - once it is binded it is not going to change runtime
	 * 
	 * Q - Can we Overload the Main method in JAVA ? we can overload main method as
	 * well but method signature has to be different
	 * 
	 * Yes, you can overload main method in Java. But the program doesn't execute
	 * the overloaded main method when you run your program, you have to call the
	 * overloaded main method from the actual main method. that means main method
	 * acts as an entry point for the java interpreter to start the execute of the
	 * application.
	 * 
	 * Q- What is var args
